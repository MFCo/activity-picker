# Thoughts Tracker

This is a simple activity picker, you can easily set what do you want to do this weekend, your favourite time, and if you want to do it alone or with friends. Then just click `Go to activities` and you'll get a list of activities that fit your requirements. [HERE IS A GIF](https://i.imgur.com/dshQ9LM.gif) where you can see the app working.

# Make it work locally

You should just git clone or download the repository and then execute:
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

Currently it's fetching from a backendless backend, but just change credentials on .env file to yours and it's done. Right now it's working with the following environment variables: REACT_APP_ID, and REACT_APP_KEY.
